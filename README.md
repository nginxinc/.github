## Default Community Health Files

This repository holds the default GitHub community health files for the `nginxinc` GitHub organization.

"Community Health Files" is a GitHub term referring to
[these specially handled files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types).
If a given organization repository does not define these files itself, GitHub defaults to the files defined in this
repository
